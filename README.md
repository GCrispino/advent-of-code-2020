My 2020 Advent of Code solutions

# Running
All challenge code solutions are name in the format `x-y.py`,
where x is the day number and y is a if it the day's part one, or b if part two.

To run one of the solutions, you should have Python 3 installed,
and enter the following in your terminal, while in the project's root:
`$ python days/x-y.py`
